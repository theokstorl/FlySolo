	<p><font color="white">
		The one thing people always wish they had more of is time. However, in the current 
		technological age we are living in, time is at a premium. It is FlySolo Company's 
		mission to provide society with more time. According to the <a href="https://
		www.census.gov/search-results.html?q=commute+times&page=1&stateGeo=none&searchtype
		=web&cssp=SERP&_charset_=utf-8" target="_blank" style="color: 90EE90"> US Census Bureau</a>, Americans 
		spend an average of 26.1 minutes commuting to work per day. This is equal to more 
		than 150 hours per year on the road. The FlySolo reduces travel time by roughly 75%, 
		meaning customers can expect to enjoy an extra 100 hours of free time per year.
